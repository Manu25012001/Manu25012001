# Mohit - AI and Space Exploration Enthusiast

## About Me

Hello! I'm **Mohit**, an ambitious learner and AI developer. I have a passion for **AI, machine learning, and deep learning**, and I'm driven by a desire to achieve extraordinary things that go beyond everyday goals. With a background in **Commerce** and a self-driven dive into **AI**, I've developed a deep understanding of neural networks and modern AI architectures like **Transformers**. I'm currently pursuing a diploma in **AI and ML** and exploring ways to leverage **AI for space exploration**—particularly around the concept of creating **wormholes** to enable faster-than-light travel.

## Areas of Interest

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Understanding and building AI models from scratch, including deep learning models like **LLaMA** and **GPT**.
- **Space Exploration**: Using AI to solve complex space-related problems like faster space travel, potentially creating civilizations that reach **Type 3 on the Kardashev Scale**.
- **Machine Learning**: Designing and implementing ML models, exploring applications in **NLP, summarization, and model fine-tuning**.
- **Mathematics**: Self-taught in mathematical concepts related to AI like vectors, tensors, and matrix operations.

## Achievements

- Built my own **Transformer architecture** from scratch.
- Implemented a custom version of **LLaMA 2** for text generation, with the ability to fine-tune on new data.
- Successfully trained models on custom datasets using **Kaggle** and experimented with **LLaMA 3.1** on **Google Colab**.
- **Bachelor of Commerce** graduate from **Himachal Pradesh University** (2021).

## Current Projects

- **LLaMA 2 from Scratch**: Developing the **LLaMA 2** model from scratch using **PyTorch**, with a focus on loading checkpoints and fine-tuning the model for text generation.
- **Nano GPT**: Working on building a miniature version of the GPT model from scratch and training it on my own dataset.
- **Space AI Research**: Exploring ways to combine **AI with space exploration**, particularly in the field of **wormhole creation**.

## Future Goals

- **Create My Own Civilization**: I'm aiming to reach **Type 3 on the Kardashev Scale** by developing groundbreaking technologies.
- **Helping Others**: I’m thinking about creating AI solutions to assist those who are helpless, using technology to solve real-world problems.
- **AI and Full Stack Integration**: Working on building full-stack applications that use **GANs** and other AI-driven technologies.

## My Learning Approach

I learn best by **diving into code**—breaking down models like **Transformers**, customizing architectures, and writing functions from scratch. I also constantly experiment with pre-trained models, fine-tuning them for my own datasets. My philosophy is simple: **if others can do it, so can I**, so I keep trying until I succeed!
